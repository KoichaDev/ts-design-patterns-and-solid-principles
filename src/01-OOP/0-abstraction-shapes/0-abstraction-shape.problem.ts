/**
 * Create a program to have multiple shapes, which includes a circle, a rectangle
 * and the responsibility of our program is to calculate the area of the shapes
 * as well as the perimeter of the shape, despite of the shape that we provide to it.
 * It can be a circle, and a rectangle to start off with, but later on, we can have
 * more shapes like square etc.
 *
 * In the end, we want to provide a simple interface, or a single function to our user
 * or our developers, where they can use this single function, such as e.g. we want to
 * create a function called calculateTotalArea(). This function will be exposed
 * to the area of the shape, and they will not be exposed to any other thing.
 * We will not expose to a circle class, or the the rectangle class, or to the shape class
 * Our responsibility here is to provide them with a single function, which is called
 * calculate total area, and this function should be able to calculate the area of any shape
 * that is provided to this particular function
