 * TODO:   Create BankAccount class
 * TODO: Create methods that is depositing and withdrawing
 * TODO: Every bank account is going to have a balance.
 * ! The balance of the bank account should only be modifiable through depositing money, or through withdrawing money.
 * ! You should not able to take the bank account instance, for example accessing bank.balance = 123 and change the balance.
 * ! User of the class should not have direct access to the balance property. This is because developer should not be able to manipulate
 * ! the balance in the bank account directly, and change the balance like bank.balance = 200 USD which for example it has 100 USD original value
 * * This is for obvious reason, because you would only deposit some amount to a bank account or withdraw an amount from a bank account, and that's
 * * how you determine the balance of the bank account, so in other words, this bank.balance property should be hidden, or encapsulated
